			Nearly one week after protests <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/01/anti-cop-protesters-in-brooklyn-blast-fare-evasion-crackdown/" target="_blank"> broke out in downtown Brooklyn </a> over transit enforcement, activists are asking whether the police are unfairly targeting minorities in the campaign to target turnstile jumpers. </p>

		<p>
      Though activists claim that police unfairly target minorities for fare enforcement, data at the transit district-level suggests location, more than race alone, determines who is being ticketed.

      Transit District 11, for example, which covers the eastern half of the Bronx, sees a nearly 93% rate of black and Hispanic individuals being ticketed for violating turnstiles.
		</p>
		<p>
      Contrast this against Transit District 01, which covers the Upper West Side and much of Midtown Manhattan, which has a much more heterogeneous group of fare violators being ticketed, with nearly 26% being white.
		</p>

    <p>Though in every transit district black and Hispanic violators make up a majority of all tickets written, data reveals some districts more profoundly target these populations than others.
