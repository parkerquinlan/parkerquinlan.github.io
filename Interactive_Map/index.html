			At a Dec 5 press conference to discuss crime statistics, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that situations of domestic abuse account for nearly 20% of all murders in the city. </p>

		<p>
      Part of a larger surge of domestic violence in New York, data from city officials reveals that reports of domestic violence continues to persist across the five boroughs, even when accounting for population.
    </p>

		<p>
			Throughout the city, incidents of domestic violence remain high, even as city officials attempt to raise awareness about the issue, and resources which exist for victims.

			The de Blasio administration has been working to reduce the overall number of domestic violence incidents, though data from the Mayor’s Office to End Domestic and Gender-Based Violence indicates the problem is still persistent in many parts of the city.
		</p>
		<p>
			Though primarily concentrated in the Bronx and eastern Brooklyn, the rate of domestic violence incidence reports – a form filed by the NYPD to indicate a domestic incident may have taken place – is also high in northern Staten Island.
		</p>
		<p>
			The city has a requires employee training on sexual assualt and training, though advocates are concerned that the training does not go far enough, and should be expanded.
		</p>

		<p>
			Stephanie Nilva, Executive Director of Day One, a nonprofit which provides trainings on sexual abuse and domestic violence, expressed some skepticism about whether the 45-minute city mandiated training was adequate.
		</p>
		<p>
			“Our trainings can range from one hour to one day depending on the needs of the organization,” said Nilva, “It is very unlikely that you will be able to cover everything in a 45-minute training.”
		</p>
		<p>
			Still, in the wake of the #MeToo movement, Nilva believes that the city will continue to have increased pressure to address the issue.
		</p>
		<p>
			“Greater awareness is leading to more reporting and disclosures, and relationships violence.” Said Nilda, “Institutions structures and systems, are less able to actively ignore or brush under the rug of an issue they’re being presented to.”
