			Zadel DeLeon was afraid to let his girlfriend, Jennifer Pera, walk alone at night down 149th Street near Third Avenue after leaving his apartment. </p>

		<p>
			Concerned that police aren’t doing enough, DeLeon, 20, worries that because the number of individuals with addiction on the street keeps rising, his neighborhood is no longer safe.
		</p>

		<p>
			“You don’t see enough police in the streets,” said DeLeon, adding that he wished the police would better patrol the streets of the South Bronx, and arrest more violent people.
		</p>
		<p>
			Despite this, addiction specialists are concerned that a mentality of criminalization will only make the problem worse, and that despite a Sept. 4 announcemnt by the federal government that New York State has been awarded millions in the last two years to fight addiction, a cultural shift is necessary to end the opioid crisis.

			“They have a lot of shame, and a lot of fear because of their addiction. As this builds, you begin to see them start to go underground, and take greater risks. This could result in them getting hepatitis, or worse, HIV.” said Bart Majoor, Deputy and Clinical Director at St. Mary’s Corner for Harm Reduction, who has nearly 30-years of experience as an addiction specialist.
		</p>

		<p>
				The culture of stigma surrounding addiction, has even made it difficult for new addiction centers to even be built in parts of the South Bronx.
		</p>

		<p>
			“We’re located in a place where our patients cannot reach us. They do not want us in the area near Lincoln Hospital.” said Angela Torres, a Senior Addiction Counselor at Lincoln Recovery Center, an extension of Lincoln Hospital.

		<p>
			Torres, who has been an addiction counselor for over 20 years, said that in part because of a local stigma about treatment centers, their facility was forced to accept their current facilities location, on E. 142nd Street.

			Even though in the entire borough there are only 65 treatment facilities according to the Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services (OSAS) website, only 6 are below 149th Street, with the nearest long-term residential facility, United Bronx Parents, Inc, being located on 151st, and which only treats to women.

			Though many addiction specialists understand the desire by many residents to clean up the streets, they believe that sympathy, not criminal prosecution, will lead to an end of the opioid crisis.
		</p>
		<p>
			“We’re 40 years into the war on drugs, and it’s been such an incredible waste of time, and money, and energy when you talk to most insiders.” Dr. Majoor said, “We need to actually treat this like a medical issue, not like a crime.”
